        <h2>📜 Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          I wanted to be a programmer, but never had the chance, so I started at a young age with my own businesses doing custom garage doors, gates, automations and cctv. It was only later, that I completed an online test for the WethinkCode programming course.
        </p>

        <p>
          This changed my life. During the two years at WeThinkCode I took part in various hackathons, won many prizes, and was also part in starting a robotics lab at WeThinkCode.

        <h2>👩🏽‍🚀 Projects</h2>
        <p>
          This lead to my internship and later placement at FastNet IoT(Telkom) as a junior Hardware Architect. FastNet gave me the opportunity to learn from engineers that has been in the field for decades. FastNet focusing on R&D, also allowed me to interface and build systems with the latest technologies. I was privileged to learn hardware(In depth) and software in practice. I worked on the OculusID and Ampath tracking projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the BCX(Telkom) merger, I was moved from FastNet IoT, to BCX(ITS DE Digital Development) where I was once again privileged to work on projects like the COVID-19 Tracking system, the Ventilator Management System[COVID] and also worked on the New Municipal Budget Management system (Azure & Linux VM[role: DevSecOps Engineer] ).
